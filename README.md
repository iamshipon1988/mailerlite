# mailerlite
Super top secret project for MailerLite. This is life changing project that will change the way people look at email! 

# Private!
Seriously, don't look at the content of this project. It's top secret. Shoo!

# Notes
I took the basic styles of your website and added a few extra elements to help it stand out. The objective of the site is to provide information on the product. Purpose behind a landing page is to get them to sign up for a specific service. My understanding it that the newsletter landing page will be linked to from internal pages or used on advertisements to get a return of increased sign up. Therefore, I made it stand out more than the internal pages. 

- This uses Boostrap 4 as a framework, advanced using few typical classhelpers I use in projects. 
- I use my own variables and mixins files to make it easier for me to work with. But the bootstrap ones can be used in it's place.
- Using FontAwesome free, but pro should be used. Using free since this is a public project.
- Text being used on the pages are all dummy. Should be replaced with real content.
